configure: support builds using ccache

The configure script checks whether CC is executable by means of a check
'type $CC'. However, when using ccache, CC is normally set to "ccache gcc"
(using the appropriate paths). Such a compound string is not recognized by
type, however, and thus configure bails out.

This patch changes the check 'type $CC' with a compile test.

Upstream status: backport of
http://roy.marples.name/projects/dhcpcd/info/5f4bf91142fceac502c478886aeb5079a184bb43

Note: a simplification of this patch was accepted upstream, but turns out to be
non-usable by the Xtensa architecture. This was also reported upstream and
should normally be reverted soon.
